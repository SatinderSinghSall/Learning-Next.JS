# Learning-Next.JS

That's awesome! Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building full-stack web apps easier. It adds features like:

### âœ… Key Features of Next.js

1. **File-based routing** â€“ Pages are based on the file structure in the `pages/` or `app/` directory.
2. **Server-side rendering (SSR)** â€“ You can fetch data on the server and send pre-rendered HTML to the client.
3. **Static site generation (SSG)** â€“ Pre-renders pages at build time for performance.
4. **API routes** â€“ Build backend endpoints directly inside your app.
5. **Built-in image optimization** â€“ With the `<Image />` component.
6. **Middleware and edge functions** â€“ Run code before a request is completed.
7. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** â€“ Rebuild specific pages after deployment.

#### **Basic Setup**

Install Next.js using the official CLI:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

#### **Understand the Folder Structure**

* `/pages` â€“ Each file becomes a route.
* `/public` â€“ Static assets.
* `/components` â€“ Your React components.
* `/styles` â€“ CSS or Tailwind files.

A file like `pages/about.js` becomes accessible at `yourdomain.com/about`.

Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and offers seamless deployment:
