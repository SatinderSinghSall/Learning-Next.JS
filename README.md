## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Learning-Next.JS

That's awesome! Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building full-stack web apps easier. It adds features like:

### âœ… Key Features of Next.js

1. **File-based routing** â€“ Pages are based on the file structure in the `pages/` or `app/` directory.
2. **Server-side rendering (SSR)** â€“ You can fetch data on the server and send pre-rendered HTML to the client.
3. **Static site generation (SSG)** â€“ Pre-renders pages at build time for performance.
4. **API routes** â€“ Build backend endpoints directly inside your app.
5. **Built-in image optimization** â€“ With the `<Image />` component.
6. **Middleware and edge functions** â€“ Run code before a request is completed.
7. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** â€“ Rebuild specific pages after deployment.

#### **Basic Setup**

Install Next.js using the official CLI:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

#### **Understand the Folder Structure**

* `/pages` â€“ Each file becomes a route.
* `/public` â€“ Static assets.
* `/components` â€“ Your React components.
* `/styles` â€“ CSS or Tailwind files.

A file like `pages/about.js` becomes accessible at `yourdomain.com/about`.

Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and offers seamless deployment:

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Add-ons

* **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Modern utility-first CSS.
* **TypeScript** â€“ Optional typing for safer code.
* **Prisma** â€“ For databases.
* **NextAuth.js** â€“ Authentication made easy.

### ðŸ“š Best Resources

* [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
* [Vercel Learn](https://vercel.com/learn/nextjs)
* [FreeCodeCamp's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WmNXEVia8I)
* [Fullstack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) â€“ Covers React & backend basics too.

Next.js is a React framework used to build web applications, offering features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized performance. It simplifies web development by providing routing, data fetching, and other functionalities, making it suitable for both simple and complex projects.
